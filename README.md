> _Nihilis, the RPG that takes you to the end of the world._

## overview

Nihilis is the fusion of a world simulator, a procedural story generator, and a traditional OSR-styled role-playing game. Gameplay takes place in one of several epochs, from the tribal beginnings of a world all the way through its ultimate fall to the shadow, and player impact on the world is emphasized through systems like player landholding and civics, persistent NPC relationships, trade and political system emulation, and more.
